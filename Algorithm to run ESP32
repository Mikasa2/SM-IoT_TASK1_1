# install the ESP32 boards into the Arduino IDE:

Here is what you need to do to install the ESP32 boards into the Arduino IDE:

1. Open the Arduino IDE. Make sure that you are at version 1.8 or higher, if not then update your IDE with the latest version.
2. Click on the File menu on the top menu bar.
3. Click on the Preferences menu item. This will open a Preferences dialog box.
4. You should be on the Settings tab in the Preferences dialog box by default.
5. Look for the textbox labeled “Additional Boards Manager URLs”.
6. If there is already text in this box add a coma at the end of it, then follow the next step.
7. Paste the following link into the text box – https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
8. Click the OK button to save the setting.

#add the ESP32 boards to your Arduino IDE:

1. In the Arduino IDE click on the Tools menu on the top menu bar.
2. Scroll down to the Board: entry (i.e. Board: Arduino/Genuino Uno).
3. A submenu will open when you highlight the Board: entry.
4. At the top of the submenu is Boards Manager. Click on it to open the Boards Manager dialog box.
5. In the search box in the Boards Manager enter “esp32”.
6. You should see an entry for “esp32 by Espressif Systems”. Highlight this entry and click on the Install button.
7. This will install the ESP32 boards into your Arduino IDE.

#Test Installiton
1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Select your Board in Tools > Board menu (in my case it’s the DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1).
3. Select the Port (if you don’t see the COM Port in your Arduino IDE, you need to install the ESP32 CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers).
4. Open the following example under File > Examples > WiFi (ESP32) > WiFi Scan.
5. Open A new sketch.
6. Press the Upload button in the Arduino IDE. Wait a few seconds while the code compiles and uploads to your board.
7. If everything went as expected, you should see a “Done uploading.” message.
8. Open the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor at a baud rate of 115200.
9. Press the ESP32 on-board Enable button and you should see the networks available near your ESP32:
